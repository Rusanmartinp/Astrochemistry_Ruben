  \abstract
  % context heading
   {Double Periodic Variables (hereafter DPVs) are a group of close interacting binaries of Algol type where the less massive star is more evolved and it is filling its Roche lobe transfering mass to its more massive accreting companion forming an optically thick accretion disc. These systems presents a characteristic long period that is an order of magnitude longer than the corresponding orbital period, many of them with a characteristic ratio of approximately 35.}
  % aims heading
   {In this work we study how the dynamo number and the ratio of long to orbital period changes throughout the evolution of our sample consisting on 17 DPV systems with well known stellar parameters, 11 of which also have known modulation periods.}
  % methods heading
   {We performed a multiparametric $\chi^{2}$ minimization test to fit our systems to the binary evolution models proposed by \citet{vanrensbergen2008} in order to find a pontentially good description of the evolution of each system of our sample.}
  % results heading
   {We have found a relatively good fit for 11  out of 17 systems.}
